This is a 'fork' of Colloquy that reads all the messages in one or all of your
open chat rooms using Mac's hilarious text-to-speech voices. I use fork in 
quotations since Colloquy's source isn't on github, it's here:

http://source.colloquy.info/svn/trunk

Based on Resources/BSD License.txt, it appears Colloquy has been released
under the BSD License, which I have propagated. 


To turn on voices, open Colloquy Preferences (Command-,) and check off
Text to Speech in the Alerts tab. You can supply a room such as "#colloquy" 
to limit the reading to only one room. I took the liberty of speeding up
the voices a little and removing two of the most annoying ones. 

Unlike Colloquy trunk, this requires 10.5+.
